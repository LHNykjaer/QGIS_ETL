# QGIS as ETL tool using Python
 
## Requirements 
This concept requires a QGIS installation on the computer that executes the jobs.
It requires the file python-qgis.bat, which normally can be
located in one of these folders :

**_<OSGeo4W_ROOT>\bin_** or **_<QGIS_ROOT>\bin_**

If you are usig a dev- or ltr version, the filename is different eg: _python-qgis-ltr.bat_
